# sentinel1_rtc
A jupyter book tutorial demonstrating accessing and working with Sentinel-1 RTC imagery using xarray. 
This tutorial demonstrates accessing and working with two datasets of Sentinel-1 RTC imagery: 
1) a time series processed by Alaska Satellite Facility's On-Demand Processing Server and downloaded locally as geotiffs and 
2) a dataset processed and made available as cloud-optimized geotiffs by Microsoft Planetary Computer.

It contains notebooks related to data access, organizing and handling metadata, data inspection, comparing datasets and exploratory analysis and visualization all with a focus on demonstrating xarray functionality for remote sensing data workflows 

Feel free to reach out with questions and feedback
