# Summary

This tutorial demonstrates accessing and working with various publicly available (no?) Sentinel-1 Radiometric Terrain Corrected imagery datasets using xarray and other open-source python software packages. It contains examples of how to work with large volumes of cloud-processsed imagery locally, as well as accessing and working with cloud-optimized data types hosted and accessed from a cloud-based data catalog (phrasing?). A large portion of this tutorial was focused on making sure that appropriate metadata is carried through processing steps and organized in an easy-to-work with way to prepare analysis-read data. The tutorial also demonstrates preliminary dataset comparisons through visualizations and the beginnings of an exploratory data analysis workflow. Hopefully, you got an idea of how to leverage **xarray** functionality at these various steps of a typical remote sensing data analysis workflow.
